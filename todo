As a Job Seeker, I want to search for jobs with filters 
(title, skills, location, salary, remote/on-site, visa sponsorship) 
so I can find opportunities that match my needs.



So each Job needs to havce all these attrs:
    title, skills, location, salary, remote/on-site, visa sponsorship (done)


Filter multi select on these attrs on the html make the page: 
    title, skills, location, salary, remote/on-site, visa sponsorship

make the query for the filtering:(should be good)
